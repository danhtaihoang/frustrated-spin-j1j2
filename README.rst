Spin resistivity in the frustrated J1-J2 model
=============================================================================================

Abstract
-----------------------------
We study in this paper the resistivity encountered by Ising itinerant spins traveling in the so-called J1 - J2 frustrated simple cubic Ising lattice. For the lattice, we take into account the interactions between nearest-neighbors and next-nearest-neighbors, J1 and J2 respectively. Itinerant spins interact with lattice spins via a distance-dependent interaction. We also take into account an interaction between itinerant spins. The lattice is frustrated in a range of J2 in which we show that it undergoes a very strong first-order transition. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we calculate the resistivity ρ of the itinerant spins and show that the first-order transition of the lattice causes a discontinuity of ρ.
